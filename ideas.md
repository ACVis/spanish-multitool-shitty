Spanish Learning Tools Idea

LibriVox Community read audiobooks: https://librivox.org/search?primary_key=5&search_category=language&search_page=1&search_form=get_results  

Gutendex, project gutenberg api: https://gutendex.com/books/?languages=es&sort=popular

Speech sythesis: https://github.com/jaxcore/jaxcore-say-node

SPANISH VERB CONJUGATION DATABASE: https://github.com/ghidinelli/fred-jehle-spanish-verbs

Python SPANISH CONJUGATOR: https://github.com/Benedict-Carling/spanish-conjugator

Analyzes ebook, sorts words by frequency. Can add blacklist to exclude words like "el, la, donde" or add filters like "exclude words < 5 characters". Also, could create a list an automatically formatted document of words and their definitions that fall outside of lists like "1000 most common spanish words" so that you can read up on rare, atypical, uncommon words ahead if time. 

Aug 19,23 Edit: Use some some sort of NLP or entity tagger to process text. So, the cheat sheet for books and shows can seperate things by type. For instance, could seperate out nouns, like people, places, things separate from verbs. Might be able to also use the tagger to keep the list of verbs from being different tenses of the same rare verb. If it can identify tenses, then you could also have the user specify which tenses they want to focus on. Or we might be able to use the **spanish verb conjugation** database and do a reverse lookup

Perhaps could also spit these into flash cards of various formats. May also help to add this to subtitle functionality. Also, maybe could pick some complicated sentences to study by looking for particular tenses (search for a period to find start of a sentence, then find length of sentence (longer = harder), then check iterate over list of endings against last x characters per word in sentence (if word is longer than ending to be compared against). Add a customizable ratio per tense, so present tense is 1, "-ando" tense is 1.2, subjunctive might be 2.0. Add the points per sentence. Add points if there's reflexive words. Add points if there's words outside of 1000 most popular lists. Take 10 most difficult sentences, get their translations. Maybe with a database of these you could run machine/neural learning on them and then use that as an alternate method to choose for running on other documents (subtitles, books). 

This and other things can be added as a bunch of spanish learning services on a website. 


## Idea 2

Livestream composed of public domain spanish audiobooks (like librivox) stitched together into one long stream, with the Title and Chapter, etc overlaid, perhaps even a way to vote through chat or on website if ppl like or dislike that particular book OR that particular reader/reading.

Books would be automatically scraped, downloaded and stitched. I would do no manual editing. Maybe audio filters for noise or ppl voice, or normalizing might be applied.


- Can we scrape Netflix subtitles?

## General Idea

An amalgation of tools that all help with learning, even if small or quirky. 

Daily spanish meditation
Daily word - basic
Daily word - strict/advanced: you must answer correctly the definition for the previous day's word (or X number of days) before getting a new word
Journal entry - prompt the user for a journal/diary entry (of at least 300 words?)
Conjugation quizzer
Irregular words
Flashcards

Daily writing prompts


## BIG IDEA
SRS Flashcards like Anki, except notes or cards can graduate to different types as you learn

like if a card hits the (customizable) 30day mark, then it would automatically transition to the "arrange word blocks" type (customizable) . then once you hit 30 on that it mighht transition to "type out the translation from nothing, into a text area"

Front: One must always be vigilant Back: spanish translation
--->
One must always be vigilant
Arrange text blocks: [ser] [vigilante] [hay que] [siempre]
-->
One must always be vigilant
Text field: ___type exact-ish translation****
